Hey there! I'm a coding enthusiast who primarily dabbles in TypeScript but also loves to tinker with Python, Go, Rust, and C++. With a degree from IIT BHU and 1.5 years of professional experience under my belt, I've developed a knack for creating innovative solutions from scratch. My passion lies in system design and the exciting world of web3, with a special focus on Solana. Right now, I'm diving deep into a few projects on Solana, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. When I'm not coding, you'll find me dreaming up my next big idea or exploring new tech frontiers. Let's create something amazing together! 🚀
